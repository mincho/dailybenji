# About Us

The Daily Benji is built by a tiny team who cares about privacy, clarity, and cutting through the noise.

We’re not trying to gamify your life, track your every move, or sell your data. We just want to help you see your spending clearly — with one honest email each morning.

Benji is the kind of product we wish existed, so we built it.

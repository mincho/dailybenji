# Privacy & Security

Benji is built with privacy in mind:

- We **don’t track** you.
- We **don’t sell** your data.
- We **don’t show** ads.
- Your data is **yours** — we just help you see it.

Our backend uses secure, encrypted storage and transmission. We delete sensitive email data after parsing it, and we don’t store full emails — only what’s necessary to generate your report.

Transparency is the point. If you ever have questions, [reach out](mailto:hello@dailybenji.com).
